        <h2> Hobbies </h2>
        <h3> Artistic Painting </h3>
        <p> Art painting on walls has become my favorite hobby and my main job in Brazil. After some time working in the marketing field, I discovered a new passion through illustrations. I create illustrations and do artistic paintings on walls, usually for children's rooms. I love to spend time painting. If you want, you can visit my Instagram page to see all my jobs:
